# Device Driver Development Repository

## Overview
This repository contains various device driver implementations for embedded systems, focusing on different microcontrollers and peripheral interfaces. It provides a structured approach to understanding low-level hardware interaction, register-level programming, and efficient driver development.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized into the following sections:
- **GPIO Drivers**: Implementation of General Purpose Input/Output drivers for various microcontrollers.
- **UART Drivers**: Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter drivers for serial communication.
- **SPI Drivers**: Serial Peripheral Interface implementations for high-speed device communication.
- **I2C Drivers**: Inter-Integrated Circuit communication protocols for sensor and peripheral integration.
- **PWM Drivers**: Pulse Width Modulation drivers for motor control and signal generation.
- **ADC & DAC Drivers**: Analog-to-Digital and Digital-to-Analog Conversion drivers.
- **RTOS-Based Drivers**: Device drivers designed for real-time operating systems like FreeRTOS.

Each module contains:
- **Register-level configurations**
- **Interrupt handling mechanisms**
- **Bare-metal and abstraction-layer-based implementations**

## Supported Microcontrollers
The drivers in this repository support multiple architectures, including:
- **ARM Cortex-M (STM32, NXP, TI)**
- **AVR (ATmega, ATtiny series)**
- **ESP32/ESP8266**
- **Raspberry Pi (Linux-based device drivers)**

## Development Tools & Environment
The drivers are developed using industry-standard tools:
- **STM32CubeIDE / Keil uVision** (For STM32-based drivers)
- **AVR Studio / MPLAB X IDE** (For AVR and PIC microcontrollers)
- **PlatformIO / Arduino IDE** (For ESP32/ESP8266 development)
- **Linux Kernel Module Development** (For Raspberry Pi and ARM-based platforms)

## Getting Started

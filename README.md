# Device Driver Repository

## Overview
This repository contains implementations of various device drivers for embedded systems. The drivers are developed in C for microcontrollers and embedded platforms, following best practices for modularity, efficiency, and hardware abstraction.

## Features
- Low-level hardware interaction
- Modular and scalable driver architecture
- Support for multiple peripherals
- Optimized performance and memory usage

## Supported Drivers
- GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output)
- UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter)
- SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface)
- I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit)
- PWM (Pulse Width Modulation)
- ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter)
